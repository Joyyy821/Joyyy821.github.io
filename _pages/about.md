Welcome! My name is Yang Jiao. I am a highly driven and insightful graduate of the Master's program in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego, with a specialization in *Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control*. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in *Electronic and Information Engineering* from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ) in 2022.

I always feel motivated and thrilled about mathematical modeling and real robot applications. My current research interests revolve around multi-robot systems, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and motion planning.

I have spent almost 4 years immersing myself in the exciting field of robotic research. Since October 2022, I've been working in the [Cognitive Robotics Lab](https://www.cogrob.org/) at UCSD, advised by Prof. Henrik Christensen. My focus is on indoor semantic SLAM. Prior to that, from July 2020 to August 2022, I worked in the [Robotics &amp; AI Lab](https://crai.cuhk.edu.cn/) at CUHKSZ and was advised by Prof. Huihuan Qian, where our research centered on marine robotics and modular robots.

Please feel free to connect with me, explore my projects and research, or discuss potential collaboration!
