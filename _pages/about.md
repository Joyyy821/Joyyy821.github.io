Welcome! My name is Yang Jiao. I am a highly driven and insightful PhD student (incoming@25 Fall) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, supervised by [Prof. Henrik Christensen](https://hichristensen.com/). Previously, I completed my Master's degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCSD in 2024, with a specialization in *Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control*. I earned my Bachelor's degree in *Electronic and Information Engineering* from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ) in 2022.

I always feel motivated and thrilled about mathematical modeling and real robot applications. My current research interests revolve around multi-robot systems, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and motion planning.

I have spent 4 years immersing myself in the exciting field of robotic research. Since October 2022, I've been working in the [Cognitive Robotics Lab](https://www.cogrob.org/) at UCSD. My focus is on indoor semantic SLAM. Prior to that, from July 2020 to August 2022, I worked in the [Robotics &amp; AI Lab](https://crai.cuhk.edu.cn/) at CUHKSZ and was advised by Prof. Huihuan Qian, where our research centered on marine robotics and modular robots.

Please feel free to connect with me, explore my projects and research, or discuss potential collaboration!
